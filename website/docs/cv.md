## ABOUT ME
<p class="align-text">I consider myself an easy person to deal with, both professionally and socially. I like to stay organized to make work easier for myself and others.
 I am ambitious, proactive, demanding with myself, I strive to learn where I went wrong before, and I always try to maintain a good relationship with everyone around me. In my spare time I usually play sports, whether it's going to the gym or playing basketball.

In the future I'd like to be in an environment where I can evolve quickly, and where I can learn with the rest of the team without toxic or selfish mentalities.
In my opinion it is never too late to learn or even relearn something</p>
